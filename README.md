# This is my profile created for week 2 challenge

Profile page was created to complete challenge in Bootcamp.
There were a number of acceptance criteria which had to be included:
-@media responsivenes to various widths
-use of "a href= " for linking content on page to a link
-different sizing of project images
-use of profile image or avatar
-links to my social media sites and contact details


The project was approched with low expectation of using the site in the future due to the complete lack of experience of creating a web page. As my profile page will be very important in the future, I will expect to create another one once I am more confident and knowledgable of the practice. 

Some support was received in the creation of Work section due to it's ccomplexity.
